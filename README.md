# Mental-Health-Screening-Application

## Overview
In today's world, mental health is a significant concern for many individuals. The conventional method of diagnosing mental health issues involves people approaching professionals for check-ups and receiving feedback. However, this process can be time-consuming and inefficient on a large scale.
To address this, I have developed an automated report-generating application that identifies individuals who are most likely to be experiencing depression. This allows professionals to allocate their time more effectively to those in need.
The report is generated by extracting key vocal characteristics that may be indicative of various mental health conditions.
I am undertaking this project under the guidance of Prof. Nipun Batra.
